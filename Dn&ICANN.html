                    A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control within the Internet.
                    Generally, it is what you type in the address bar to reach the website. For example, the domain name of Google is www.google.com.Domain names are organized hierarchically from right to left. The right-most portion of a domain name is called the top-level domain (TLD). The .com TLD is probably the most well-known, but there are many others, 
                    such as .net, .org, .edu, and .mil. (Country codes, such as .us and .fr, are also TLDs.) When you register a domain name, you can choose which TLD to use (though some TLD's, 
                    such as .edu and .gov, are restricted to certain types of organizations). The next domain name level after the TLD is called the second-level domain. This is the part of the domain name that you define. For example,  janesmith.realtor  “janesmith” is the second-level domain and .realtor™ is the TLD. When you purchase a domain name, this is the portion
                     that you “own”, as well as any subdomains beneath it. A domain name always contains a TLD and a second-level domain.
